# SimpleLogger
Simple Logger is just that, a simple logging utility, for use in my future C++ projects.

Logging to File and Logger Prefixes are on the To-Do list.

## How To Use?
- Take the `logger.h` file, plop it somewhere (like your `includes` folder)
- Include it via `#include "includes/logger.h"` 
- (Optional) add `using namespace SimpleLogger;`
- Call it via `Logger log;`
- to then log do `log.info()` or any other level.
